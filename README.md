# Bash-Calculator

This is a quick and simple bash script that calculates an arithmatic statement using integers and the basic math operations:

1. Addition(+)
2. Subtraction(-)
3. Multiplication(*)
4. Division(/)
5. Modulus(%)
6. Exponents(**)

To use this script, download Calulator.sh, then execute it in a bash shell with your numeric statement in quotes for calculation. See below for an example:
